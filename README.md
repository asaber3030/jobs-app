# React Native Application

This App was created with some dummy data to view the application.
To review the app download the files then run `npm start` then go to Expo Go App on Android or IOS then scan the QR Code.

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

Here are some pictures of the app:
